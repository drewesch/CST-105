/** 
 * Project Instructions:
 * 1. Takes input from generated text file
 * 2. File contains string sentence
 * 3. Sentence is turned into a 6x7 array (even if string cannot fit)
 * 4. Sentence is output as string reading array from up to down
 * 
 * Notes:
 * 1. In class, you had mentioned as a hint to "use modulo" to read from up to down. Instead, I...
 * 		a. Did this: String > 1D Array > Standard Order 2D Array (printed) > Up-to-down 1D Array > New String (printed)
 * 		b. Reversed the order of the "for" loops so that increments happened in reverse order.
 * 2. I was able to make code work with any valid file path & array size. Try it out if you wish!
 * 3. Not required, but I used "run.java" to be the control class, with classes separated by main function.
